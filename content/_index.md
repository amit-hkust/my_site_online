1. ### Know Thyself: Free Credit Reports and the Retail Mortgage Market [Job Market Paper] [[Download]](Amit_credit_report.pdf)
   
   <b>Abstract:</b> Under imprecise creditworthiness information, borrowers may take erroneous credit decisions. Credit reports—which record one’s creditworthiness—became free in entire US in 2005, while they already had been free in seven states. Exploiting this in a difference-in-differences setting, I show that cheaper credit reports to consumers improved mortgage market outcomes. It resulted in increased mortgage demand and approvals, more origination to creditworthy borrowers, and reduced defaults and subprime population fraction. Also, lenders’ financial performance improved, and more consumers became first-time homeowners. Additional findings, including increased interest rates, suggest a demand-driven channel in which borrowers learn their creditworthiness from credit reports.

2. ### Do Women Receive Worse Financial Advice [[Download]](women_financial_advice.pdf)
   
   <b>Abstract:</b> Trained undercover men and women posed as potential clients and visited all 65 local financial advisory firms in Hong Kong that cater to retail investors. Each auditor was assigned to an “avatar” consisting of a specific combination of attributes. We find that women are more likely than men to receive advice to buy only individual or only local securities. This effect is significant for financial planners, but not for securities firms. Women who signal that they are highly confident, highly risk tolerant, or have a domestic outlook are especially likely to receive dominated advice. Our theoretical model interprets these patterns as an interaction between statistical discrimination and advisors’ incentives. Taste-based discrimination appears to be an unlikely explanation.
