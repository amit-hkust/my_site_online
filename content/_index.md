## Working Papers


1. ### Know Thyself: Free Credit Reports and the Retail Mortgage Market [Job Market Paper] [[Download]](files/Amit_credit_report.pdf)
   
   <b>Abstract:</b> Under imprecise creditworthiness information, borrowers may make erroneous credit decisions. Credit reports---which record one’s creditworthiness---became free in the entire U.S. in 2005, while they already had been free in seven states. Exploiting this in a difference-in-differences setting, this paper shows that cheaper credit reports to consumers improved mortgage market outcomes. The applications, approvals and borrowing in high-creditworthy areas increased, and defaults and subprime population fraction decreased. Also, first-time homeowner proportion increased, and lenders’ financial performance improved. Additional findings, including increased interest rates, suggest a demand-driven improvement in applicant pool, as consumers receive precise creditworthiness signal from their reports.

2. ### Do Women Receive Worse Financial Advice [[Download]](files/women_financial_advice.pdf)  
   <span class="author">Joint with [Utpal Bhattacharya](https://ubhattac.people.ust.hk/), [Sujata Visaria](https://www.bm.ust.hk/econ/faculty-and-staff/directory/87), and [Jing Zhao](https://af.polyu.edu.hk/people/academic-staff/dr-jing-zhao/)</span>

   <b>Abstract:</b> Trained undercover men and women posed as potential clients and visited all 65 local financial advisory firms in Hong Kong that cater to retail investors. Each auditor was assigned to an “avatar” consisting of a specific combination of attributes. We find that women are more likely than men to receive advice to buy only individual or only local securities. This effect is significant for financial planners, but not for securities firms. Women who signal that they are highly confident, highly risk tolerant, or have a domestic outlook are especially likely to receive dominated advice. Our theoretical model interprets these patterns as an interaction between statistical discrimination and advisors’ incentives. Taste-based discrimination appears to be an unlikely explanation.
