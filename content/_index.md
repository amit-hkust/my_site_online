<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
<div class=conference>
Borrowers may misestimate their probability of mortgage approval in the absence of precise signals. Credit reports, which contain signals of creditworthiness, became easily accessible for consumers since 2005 for the entire U.S., while it was already the case in seven states. A difference-in-differences strategy employing this change shows that pool quality of mortgage applicants improved as a result—approvals increased and subsequent delinquencies decreased. These findings are consistent with a mechanism where over-estimators exit and under-estimators enter the applicant pool, because easier access to credit reports reduces misestimation of one’s own probability of mortgage approval. Additional findings rule out supply-driven explanations.

<div class=conference>
Trained undercover men and women posed as potential clients and visited all 65 local financial advisory firms in Hong Kong. We find that women are more likely than men to receive advice to buy only individual or only local securities. This effect is significant for financial planners, but not for securities firms. Women who signal that they are highly confident, highly risk tolerant, or have a domestic outlook, are especially likely to receive suboptimal advice. Our theoretical model interprets these patterns as an interaction between statistical discrimination and advisors’ incentives. Taste-based discrimination is unlikely to explain the results.

<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
<div class=conference>
We show that pollution increases the offering yields of municipal bonds, indicating increased risk. We establish this using a difference-in-differences design, comparing the bonds from U.S. counties revealed to contain per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in their drinking-water supplies with the bonds from neighboring, unpolluted, same-state counties. The increase was greater for riskier bonds characterized by repayment obligation, ex-ante debt burden, unrated issuance, maturity, and bankruptcy access. The resulting pollution-related investment needs and a reduction in public sector employment and expenditure likely underlie the risk. An instrumental variable-like method utilizing airports as a potential contamination source reaffirms the causal interpretation.
