<details><summary>Abstract</summary>
<div class=conference>
Credit reports record precise creditworthiness signals, in the absence of which consumers may misjudge their creditworthiness. A federal law made credit reports free in the entire U.S. since 2005, while they had already been free in seven states. A difference-in-differences analysis of cross-state contiguous counties reveals that the change led to more mortgage applications and approvals, and fewer delinquencies and credit-history related rejections. The findings are consistent with a consumer self-learning mechanism where borrowers with high creditworthiness enter or stay in the applicant pool and those with low creditworthiness exit, improving the pool quality. Additional findings rule out supply-driven explanations.

<div class=conference>
Trained undercover men and women posed as potential clients and visited all 65 local financial advisory firms in Hong Kong. We find that women are more likely than men to receive advice to buy only individual or only local securities. This effect is significant for financial planners, but not for securities firms. Women who signal that they are highly confident, highly risk tolerant, or have a domestic outlook, are especially likely to receive suboptimal advice. Our theoretical model interprets these patterns as an interaction between statistical discrimination and advisors’ incentives. Taste-based discrimination is unlikely to explain the results.

<div class=conference>
We show that pollution increases the offering yields of municipal bonds, indicating increased risk. We establish this using a difference-in-differences design, comparing the bonds from U.S. counties revealed to contain per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in their drinking-water supplies with the bonds from neighboring, unpolluted, same-state counties. The increase was greater for riskier bonds characterized by repayment obligation, ex-ante debt burden, unrated issuance, maturity, and bankruptcy access. The resulting pollution-related investment needs and a reduction in public sector employment and expenditure likely underlie the risk. An instrumental variable-like method utilizing airports as a potential contamination source reaffirms the causal interpretation.
